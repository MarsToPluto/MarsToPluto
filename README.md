- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarsToPluto, but sorry, I couldn't find you on Pluto! 😉
- 👀 I’m all about that space escapade, complete with chilled beer, my trusty laptop, and SublimeTextV3 – reminding me incessantly to cough up for that license!
- 🌱 I’m currently diving into the depths of deep learning, aiming to teach machines to feed the world (figuratively, of course!).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects, especially those predicting the stock market.
- 📫 You can reach me on Insta @an0rn.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Pluto may be icy, but my coding skills are red hot!
